# ðŸŽ® Game Night Matcher

## Overview

Game Night Matcher helps small groups find the best multiplayer or co-op games to play together by syncing their Steam libraries, filtering compatible games, rating/voting them, and matching based on preferences. The system includes random selection among top matches.

- **Target audience:** Friends in a group Discord
- **Tech Stack:** NestJS Â· Prisma Â· PostgreSQL Â· React Â· Vite

## Problem Statement

Itâ€™s hard for groups to choose a multiplayer game everyone owns and enjoys. Steam libraries are huge, tastes differ, and group play isnâ€™t always possible. This app automates the process of discovering, voting, and matching games for your group.

---

## Goals & Scope

### MVP Features

- Login/Authentication
- Sync Steam game libraries for each user
- Filter games by multiplayer/co-op support
- Voting system: love, like, neutral, dislike
- Match games with the highest mutual preference
- Randomize among the best matches

### Out of Scope (for now)
- Adding games manually
- Scheduling feature
- Advanced matchmaking algorithms
- Support for other game platforms (Epic, GOG, etc.)
- Containerization through Docker
- Steam authentication API for logins

---

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** NestJS (Node.js framework)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (with Prisma ORM)
- **Frontend:** React (with Vite for fast dev/build)

---

## Feature List

1. **User Authentication**
2. **Steam Library Sync**
3. **Game Filtering (Multiplayer/Co-op)**
4. **Voting System**
5. **Matching Algorithm**
6. **Random Game Picker**

---

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to log in so my votes are saved.
- As a user, I want to sync my Steam library so I can see my games.
- As a user, I want to see only multiplayer/co-op games.
- As a user, I want to vote on games (like/dislike/love/neutral).
- As a group, I want to see games that we all can play and enjoy.
- As a group, I want to randomize our next game from top matches.

## Spikes & Research Tasks

> Spikes are short investigations to resolve unknowns or risks before coding.

- **Steam API Integration:**  
  How do we fetch a user's game library and multiplayer status?
- **Game Genre/Mode Detection:**  
  How to determine if a game is multiplayer or co-op?
- **Voting Models:**  
  Whatâ€™s the simplest way to store and aggregate votes?
- **Matching Logic:**  
  How do we calculate group compatibility?

```

### Data Flow

1. API syncs Steam library (calls Steam API) from time to time.
2. Backend stores games in database.
3. User logs in.
4. Frontend displays multiplayer/co-op games.
5. Users vote on games.
6. Backend aggregates votes, matches preferences.
7. UI shows matches and allows random pick.

## Database Design

### Entities

- **User**
  - id (UUID), name
  - created_at, updated_at, deleted_at
  - games (UserGame relation)
  - preferences (Preference relation)
- **Game**
  - id (UUID), title, steam_id
  - created_at, updated_at, deleted_at
  - users (UserGame relation)
  - tags (GameTag relation)
- **Tag**
  - id (UUID), name
  - created_at, updated_at, deleted_at
  - games (GameTag relation)
- **Preference**
  - id (UUID), user_id, preference (enum)
  - created_at, updated_at, deleted_at
- **UserGame** (join table)
  - user_id, game_id
  - links User and Game (many-to-many)
- **GameTag** (join table)
  - game_id, tag_id
  - links Game and Tag (many-to-many)

### Relationships

- Users have many Games (via **UserGame**)
- Games have many Tags (via **GameTag**)
- Users have many Preferences
- Tags can be genres, multiplayer, co-op, etc.
- Preferences store user-specific settings or votes

**Join Tables Explained:**
- **UserGame:** Connects users and games, allowing many users to own many games.
- **GameTag:** Connects games and tags, allowing games to have multiple tags (genre, multiplayer, co-op, etc.).

## Agile Process

### Sprint Planning

- Plan 1-2 week sprints
- Select stories from above feature list

### Standups

- Async check-ins:  
  _"I worked on X, next up is Y, blockers Z"_

### Code Review

- Pair programming or review PRs for clarity and learning if needed

### Retrospective

- After every sprint:  
  _"What worked, what didn't, how we improve"_

---

## Contributing

1. **Document before coding:** Always start with a spike or note if youâ€™re unsure.
2. **Branching:** Use feature branches per story.
3. **Pull Requests:** Submit PRs for all changes. Ask for review!
4. **Communication:** Log blockers and questions in Issues.

---

## Glossary

- **Spike:** Short research task to clarify unknowns
- **MVP:** Minimum Viable Productâ€”smallest version with core features
- **Sprint:** Short, focused period of work (1â€“2 weeks)
- **PR:** Pull Requestâ€”proposed code change
